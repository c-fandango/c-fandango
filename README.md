### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This profile is here to demonstrate the work I've done on personal projects. I've made a few public so potential employers can see evidence of some of my work.
I started most of these before I learned git and so most don't have full commit histories. Most are not designed for general use as they are usually specific to my filesystem and often have had sensitive information redacted.
